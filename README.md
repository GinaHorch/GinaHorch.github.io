## Project Requirements

 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make?

    The hero image is displayed using flex-box, with top and bottom margins, a set width, a contrasting border and border radius to make it as round as possible.

    Very brief bio in the About section of the home page with a link for more details to the about.html.

    Screenshot of successful form submission attached.

    Two example projects on the Homepage and a link to more projects in the projects.html.
- [X] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
    Included links to socials (GitHub and LinkedIn) as well as other websites - used blank to open links in a separate page.

    Yes, used header, article, form, main, nav, section and footer.

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [X] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
    I added hover; however, the colour choices are not great, I need to keep working on this.

    Not yet.

### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
    
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  
     I ran out of time to figure out how to take screenshots of hovering features and I ran out of time to add responsiveness to lots of areas.
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code: 

My apologies, I did run out of time. I will continue working on it.
