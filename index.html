        <p>Kaya, I'm Gina, and I'm excited to be transitioning into the tech industry after a rewarding career spanning over 22 years in law enforcement followed by two years in research. My journey has been driven by a deep commitment to values, and a passion for making meaningful impact on the lives of victim-survivors of child sexual abuse</p>

        <p>My career began with the Bavarian Police Force followed by the Western Australian Police Force, where I had the privilege of serving in various roles from Patrol Officer to Detective Supervisor. My focus on investigating child abuse and working within multi-agency teams allowed me to develop a nuanced understanding of trauma and a profound empathy for those affected. This dedication was recognised through awards such as the 9News Police Officer of the Year Award and a Certificate of Outstanding Performance for exemplary compassion to victims of the Australian Royal Commission into Responses to Institutional Child Sexual Abuse.</p>
   
        <p>I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with First Class Honours, equipping me with a robust theoretical and practical foundation in trauma and child sexual abuse. In my most recent role as a Research Assistant at the Australian Centre for Child Protection, I furthered my expertise by working on projects aimed at improving child protection.</p>

        <p>I am now eager to bring my extensive background in investigation, research, and trauma-informed practice to the tech industry. My goal is to leverage technology to create solutions that enhance safety, foster resilience and well-being, and empower vulnerable populations. I believe that with my unique perspective and commitment to ethical practices, I can contribute meaningfully to tech innovations that align with my passion for reconcilition and improving lives of victim-survivors.</p>
