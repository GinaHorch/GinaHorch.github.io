            <h2>My Agile Journey</h2>

            <p>My Agile journey is rooted in a 22-year career in law enforcement, followed by two years in research. While my formal Scrum Master certification 
                solidified my expertise, I’ve been embodying Agile principles throughout my professional life—fostering collaboration, prioritizing outcomes, and 
                empowering teams to deliver impactful results. </p>

            <p>As an Investigations Manager at a busy metropolitan police station, I coached and mentored team members to enhance their investigative capabilities,
                balanced agency objectives, and fostered collaboration across multiple stakeholders. These experiences taught me the value of servant leadership, adaptability, 
                maintaining transparency, and iterative improvement — key principles at the heart of Agile methodologies. As a Research Assistant, I honed these skills further, 
                facilitating cross-functional collaboration and leveraging data to inform team decision-making. </p>

            <p>Throughout my career, I have prioritised fostering collaboration, removing blockers, and ensuring alignment across diverse teams. Whether leading high-pressure, 
                multi-agency investigations or facilitating cross-functional discussions in research, I have consistently applied practices that mirror Agile principles. These 
                experiences now guide my work as a certified Scrum Master, where I am dedicated to building high-performing teams and delivering value-driven outcomes.</p>

            <p>As a Scrum Master, my vision is to create a culture of trust, collaboration, and continuous learning within teams. By empowering team members and aligning efforts
                with organisational goals, I aim to drive meaningful and impactful outcomes.
            </p>

        <h2>Agile Tools and Techniques</h2>
        <p>I have experience using tools such as Jira, Trello, and GitHub Projects to facilitate Agile workflows. 
            By applying techniques like story mapping and Kanban boards, I ensure teams remain focused and aligned on priorities. 
            These tools and techniques have been integral in my training and project work, preparing me to support teams in delivering value efficiently.</p>

        <p>My dedication to continuous learning is reflected in the numerous certifications I have earned, including Certified SAFe® 6 Scrum Master (SSM) and Professional 
            Scrum Master I (PSM I). I have also completed courses in Agile Project Management, business analysis, and software development from LinkedIn Learning and other platforms. 
            These accomplishments ensure I stay current with evolving practices and empower me to better support teams in Agile environments.</p>
